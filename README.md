## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.main{
    max-width: 1440px;
    width: fit-content;
    margin: auto;
    padding-top: 50px;
    font-variation-settings: 'wght' 500;
    color: hsl(219, 12%, 42%);
}
```
Here i firstly used 'fit-content' value and learned much about that, pretty useful
Also studied a little about inline-flex and inline-block during making new notification dots
Leaned much about variable fonts

### Continued development

After this one(actually it's the second challenge for me) I'm going to master my JavaScript skills i.e. learn Angular, TypeScript and stuff like that
